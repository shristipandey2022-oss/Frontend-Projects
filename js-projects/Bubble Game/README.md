The game challenges players to click on bubbles matching a randomly generated "Hit" number within a time limit, earning points for every correct click.

2. A grid of bubbles with random numbers is generated.

3. Click on any bubble with the number matching the "Hit" number.

4. Score increases by 10 for every correct click.

5. New bubbles and a new "Hit" number are generated after each successful hit.
